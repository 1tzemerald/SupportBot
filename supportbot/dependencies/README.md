# Setup

## Dependencies <a id="dependencies"></a>

SupportBot requires few different dependencies in order for the bot work. There isn't many to install but we still require you to have these dependencies installed.

### Global Dependencies

```
npm install
```

If that doesn't work:

```bash
npm install discord.js --save

npm install js-yaml
```
